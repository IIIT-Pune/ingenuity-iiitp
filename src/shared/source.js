        I always work alone but  this internship taught me about the importance of working in teams .Throughout the internship we had to discuss ,divide the work, fix each other’s bugs and  finish the project in the given deadline.We can learn technologies from anywhere but teamwork and coordination are the most important things  that I  got out of this internship.</p>
		<p>I got to learn  Django, Javascript,Bootstrap,real time API’s integration and made a website during the first 2 weeks along with a group of 5 and during  the next two weeks about few javascript based libraries like D3js for a different project.We had to give  8 updates one each hour .I didn’t like this idea much , I think there should be some freedom to the interns.Overall it was a good experience.

		content:`<p><strong>INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE &ndash; FinIQ Consulting Pvt. Ltd.</strong></p>
		<p>During the internship, I worked with three technical teams based on three different projects. For the first two weeks, we were divided into groups of five consisting of few MBA students and remaining B.Tech students. The task assigned was to design and develop a website or landing webpage(having five scrollable sections) for a financial relationship manager. The website had to be designed in a way that it did not resemble the usual, boring tabular structures of a typical trading website. It must be user friendly with a creative user interface for providing best experience to the relationship manager. We had a wonderful experience during the task and learnt various aspects of web designing. It helped me to gain hands-on experience of HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery.</p>
		<p>The second project was based on creating a news feed for stocks with high fluctuations on a particular day. We had to first web scrape data related to such stocks, analyse them and then web scrape news articles which could explain the cause of such fluctuations in that stock. Further, we had to create a website which would display these stocks along with the news and relevant graphs. I found this to be the most challenging task out of all the three. However, I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
		<p>The last project was related to Natural Language Processing. We had to cluster financial documents based on their similarity. This would help to create similar templates for such clustered documents. I had never worked on NLP before this. During this project, I explored a totally new field, learnt about pre-processing, vectorization, clustering algorithms, etc. The atmosphere in the company was co-operative, supportive and motivating. Overall, the internship experience was amazing!</p>
		<p><strong>PREPARATION</strong></p>
		<p>I had learnt HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Bootstrap basics in the first and second year of college. I was learning more about Data Structure and Algorithm and also working on a conference paper. Previously, I had also done some deep learning and machine learning projects. However, ML/DL are some of the most common things that recruiters find in the resumes. Hence, it is expected that you at least have fundamental knowledge about the concepts rather than only implementing it using certain libraries. FinIQ conducted various elimination rounds &ndash; aptitude, coding, group discussion followed by interviews of shortlisted candidates. My resume had probability and statistics under personal interest section. The interviewer asked me several questions related to it rather than programming ones which I was able to answer. Also, they asked me to solve a puzzle. The interview was the last round of the selection process. I realized that, today interviewers or recruiters are looking for skills other than just coding. Hence, it is important to work on our personal interests along with coding or other academic subjects.</p>`

		content:`<p>I am <strong>Dhanashree Revagade</strong>, a final-year computer science undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Information Technology Pune(IIIT Pune). </p>

		<p>This summer, I had the opportunity to complete an internship at FinIQ Consultancies Pvt. Ltd. Considering the difficult times the globe has been facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and especially the tech-industry being badly affected, it was grateful that <strong>FinIQ</strong> gave us an opportunity for a virtual internship. </p>
		
		Let me take you through the internship drive and the overall internship experience through this article.
		
		<h3><u>The Internship Drive </u>:</h3>
		
		<p>It was a 1-day process. The first round started at around 9:30 am and by 7:00 in the evening, after all the rounds were completed, the selected candidates were announced. Before beginning the internship drive, we had to submit our resumes and all the candidates were assigned an ID based on their branch.</p>
		
		<p>The panel members arrived at 9 am and briefed us about the company and the work culture. They informed us about our role, the duration, the work timings, etc. and then the different rounds began.</p>
		
		<h4>ROUND 1 - ESSAY WRITING AND BUSINESS PLAN FORMULATION:</h4>
		
		<p>We were asked to write a short essay on the given topic and to come up with a detailed business plan on a scenario they constructed. The business plan was supposed to cover and analyse every detail about financial, customer service, products and other important aspects related to the business problem given.</p>
		
		<h4>ROUND 2- APTITUDE TEST:</h4>
		
		<p>There was a 45 min aptitude test and questions on <strong>logical reasoning, language proficiency, verbal, non-verbal reasoning</strong>, etc were asked in the test. One had to be pretty quick in solving these questions to complete the whole test. </p>
		
		<h4>ROUND 3 - CODING TEST:</h4>
		
		<p>There were two coding questions which were to be completed in 45 min.<strong> One was easy and the other one was medium level. </strong></p>
		
		<h4>ROUND 5 - GROUP DISCUSSION:</h4>
		
		<p>After the coding test, all students were divided into groups of 8-10 and each group was given a topic for discussion. The panel members evaluated and marked points for the students during the 10 mins Group Discussion session.</p>
		
		<h4>ROUND 6 - PERSONAL INTERVIEW:</h4>
		<p>The personal interview had the most weightage in the overall process I felt. 
		Firstly, in the technical part, I was asked some <strong>basic OOPs and sorting concepts.</strong> Then the questions related to <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms were asked.</strong> I was asked to give multiple approaches in the given question and explain which one should be the most preferred one. Then, after going through my resume, the interviewers asked me about my recent publication and the research experience. I was also asked to explain one of my projects in depth. Because one of my projects was in Machine Learning domain and I was also undergoing a machine learning online course at that time(which was mentioned in my resume), I was asked about some machine learning concepts. Then, I was also asked to solve a probability problem on pen and paper.</p>
		
		<p>On the HR side, the interviewers asked me to explain about myself. After that,  as my resume mentioned my interest in different sports, we had a general talk about it. Then, going through the CGPA, the interviewer asked me if I was satisfied with my current CGPA and I was further questioned on my response. Then a few casual questions followed and the interview ended.</p>
		
		<p>Then when all the rounds were completed, after hearing my name in the list of selected candidates, my happiness knew no bounds. A total of 8 interns were selected - 5 boys and 3 girls.</p>
		
		<h2>The Virtual Internship Experience:</h2>
		
		<p>The internship was a really good learning experience. The people from FinIQ were very friendly and always helpful. In the first month, we worked on weekly assignments while in the second month, we extensively worked on a larger project for the complete month. We were required to post hourly updates of our work as we all were remotely working. The regular meetings with mentors and intriguing discussions with teammates made the working and learning very interesting.</p>
		
		<p>There were also many WhatsApp forums for entertainment and relaxing in the non-office hours. I enjoyed solving puzzles on the forums and also taking part in their weekend competitions. </p>
		
		<p>Overall, the experience was great and very rewarding. </p>
		
			<h2><u>Some tips and takeaways:</u></h2>
			<ul>
			  <li>Understand every detail about the things you have mentioned in your resume, face the interview confidently and be genuine during the interview.</li>
			  <li>Give your best possible efforts during the internship duration and collaboratively work with the team.</li>
			  <li>Practise explaining your projects beforehand so that you don’t mess up during the interview.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I hope my experience would help you learn some key points and ease your interview preparation task. </p>
		
		<p>All the best for your upcoming future experiences and hope you perform well in them.</p>
			
		Thank You</br>
		
		Regards,</br>
		Dhanashree`

        The Third Year - First Semester marks the beginning of Internship season at IIIT Pune. Most of
        us had no past corporate experience but possess a decent research experience at top-notch research
        institutes like IIT’s, IIIT’s, NIT’s, DRDO, CDAC, etc. while some are excellent with programming skills and
        software development. Now, this is the most perplexed situation where we have to narrow down our
        interests. Same for me, so I decided to dive into Computer Science, as I became less interested in
        Electronics stuff(being an ECE student). It was not a sudden decision but I learnt from experiences of my
        past. After an unsuccessful interview at GoJek, I decided to completely devote my time to improving my
        knowledge in the field of Computer Science particularly in Data Structures, Algorithms and other core
        subjects.<br>
        And then I started applying for Software Companies through Campus Internship drives.
    </div><div style="margin:10px">
        <h3 class="ml-0">The Selection Day</h3>
             FinIQ , The Financial Engineering Company came to our campus to conduct an internship drive
        in mid-December. I believed in the phrase,<br>
        <h6 style="color: gray;">“Whatsoever be the scenario, we always have a possibility to improve.”</h6>
        The selection procedure went into several phases including Aptitude Test, Coding Round,
        Business Planning, Technical and Managerial Interviews.
        Aptitude Test was mainly focused on Quants and Basics of Programming. Basic questions on Linear Data
        Structures were asked. Later round includes Business Planning and Brainstorming, we were given an
        idea with a virtual budget and were supposed to pen our ideas on paper keeping in mind the ways to
        expand, promote, and access the product providing innovative facilities. Technical Round revolved
        around basics of Data Structures and puzzles.<br>
        At the end of the day, 8 students got selected including me. All my friends jumped into joy
        celebrating the happiness.
    </div>
    <div style="margin:10px">
        <h3 class="ml-0">Location</h3>
        I was based at the main Developer center at FinIQ, Pune. Although due to amid spread of the
        novel Coronavirus, we were onboarded virtually for 2 months. Though the experience was virtual, we
        learnt and enjoyed it a lot.
    </div>
    <div style="margin:10px">
        <h3 class="ml-0">Work Culture:</h3>
        FinIQ, being a financial engineering company, hires engineering and management interns at the
        same time. On the very first day, we were divided into a group of five, two of us were from management
        and the rest were from engineering. Each group is allotted a mentor. The mentors were the go-to
        persons to discuss problems, clear doubts and they would be guiding us for the given task. The mentors
        were really helpful, being only interns, our ideas were given worth.
    </div>
    <div style="margin:10px">
        <h3 class="ml-0">The Projects I worked on:</h3>
                We worked on three different projects each of which was completely different and exciting.
        Initially, we were given to develop a webpage particularly the landing page which contains
        necessary details about the portfolio, stocks, etc. of the account holder. But the interesting thing was
        not to develop it classically like old-boring websites containing usual tabular structures rather it should
        be more interactive and more-like social media websites to deliver a user interface for providing
        innovative experience to the Regional Managers. It gave me a chance to get my hands dirty into webdevelopment stuff.<br>
        The second project was the most interesting and however, challenging. It includes building an
        application which fetches daily financial news feed articles related to the highly fluctuating stocks for
        various Financial Instruments. The algorithm had to first find such stocks and then fetch related news
        articles from the web with necessary article details and finally filter those articles based on interest.
        Moreover, stocks’ past history has also to be fetched in order to plot interactive financial graphs.<br>
        The last project was based on the NLP and Clustering. There were thousands of financial
        documents which had to be clustered based on the similarity of their contextual information. This
        would be helpful to create templates for similar types of documents. I worked on Text cleaning, preprocessing, feature selection, forming clusters and judging the quality of clusters based on standard
        metrics. Gladly, the overall work experience for me was fun and insightful.

    </div>
    <div style="margin:10px">
        <h3 class="ml-0">My Takeaways:</h3>
                Apart from the various technologies I explored, I found more important is communicating,
        discussing and making friends where you work, learn from your mistakes and love what you do.
